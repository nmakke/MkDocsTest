Example of mathematical formulas

# MathJax Test Page

When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

Given a data set **$\mathcal{D} =(x_i,f(x_i))_{i=1}^{n}$**, the goal is to learn the function **$f(x)$** such that **$y_i = f(x_i)$** for all data points.
